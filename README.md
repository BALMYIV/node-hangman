I'm real proud of this HW. I did this completely on my own. 
First HW I felt good enough to do that. 
I wrote the whole thing out on paper and then typed it.  
It doesn't work. A lot of bugs. The logic will work though.   
I threw some ES6 in there and tried to use some random stuff I've never used before.  
But honestly this is the first time I've not felt completely lost and doing the HW.
